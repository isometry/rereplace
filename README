ReReplace v1.0
- Robin Breathe, 2004/01/13

Reads in a configuration file with name "argv[0].map", lines in the
following format:
	^<regex pattern>$ <replace string>

Back-references are allowed in PERL style, e.g.:
	^www/(foo|bar)$ http://old/$1

Beware config file is parsed by sscanf ("%s %s"), with buffer checking.

Once loaded loops on STDIN translating <regex pattern> to <replace string>,
returning NULL when there is no match.

A <regex pattern> of "-" will return NULL (as if there had been no match).

Before each replace, the configuration file is checked for changes
(by mtime), so runtime updates are recognised immediately without HUP.

Any non-standard characters in the input are %XX encoded in the output.
